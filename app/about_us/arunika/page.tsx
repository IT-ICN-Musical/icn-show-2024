        The vibrant city was home to Anika, a Dutch-Indonesian girl with a big dream, and her down-to-earth mother, Ningsih, who had always advised her to be aware of their social standing. As her Dutch father left before she was born, she became ostracized by her peers--her only friend being a friendly slave girl from the Moluccan village, Deya. One day, they met a new slave boy, Raka, who showed his desire to escape and rebel against the oppression of the Dutch.

        At the same time, the company was facing bankruptcy, which affected the lives of the Dutch traders in Batavia. One of them being Gustaaf, the owner of Deya and Raka. As he was troubled by the situation in Batavia, his old friend and a Dutch officer, Clement, came to Batavia with an attempt to challenge the status quo.
